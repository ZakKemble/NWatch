This is the software todo list. A different microcontroller with more program space is needed first.

Tidy up code (mostly menu stuff)
Alarm snooze
Options for alarm snooze
Improve alarms menu
	- Use new WE/TU icon things
	- Enabled icon (tick symbol)
Improve games menu
Options for setting what up and down buttons do when on the main watch display (open stopwatch/alarms/games etc)
Make menu option name animated, move off then back on or something
sleep mode options
	- Off
	- Low power (dim screen)
Instead of loading all alarms from EEPROM to RAM at startup, just load from EEPROM as needed
Reduce CPU clock if animations are disabled (and at other times too?)
Update the display less often (saves power)
	- Only draw when needed
	- Seperate logic and drawing
Sometimes the sounder 'pops' due to bad waveform output
Sometimes the watch turns on the display when its not supposed to (system alarm - hour beeps)
Options for LEDs (brightness etc)
Fancy USB plugged in screen anim?
Option for 12 hour time
Delay battery voltage measurement when waking up
Countdown timer
More games?
